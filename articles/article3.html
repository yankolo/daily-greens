                <p class="article-paragraph">Currently, the only people allowed to grow marijuana are patients approved for medical marijuana use from a doctor, in Canada.</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">In general, "every one (1) gram of dried marijuana authorized will result in the production of five plants indoors or two plants outdoors" Health Canada states on its website.</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">As a side note, if you do not possess the know-how or do have the time or space to cultivate your own marijuana, you can designate someone else to grow marijuana for you. The only conditions is that they must pass a background check showing that they haven't been convicted of a drug offence in the last 10 years, and that they are not growing for more than two people, themselves included.</p>

				<p class="article-paragraph">Canada currently has 34 Health Canada approved producers, which are the only legal source to purchase marijuana under current laws (2017). However, in the future the Government of Canada proposes that in July, 1st 2018, adults over the age of 18 can legally possess up to 30 grams of legal cannabis in public. In addition, adults will be allowed to grow up to four plants per household at a maximum height of one metre from a legal seed or seedling.</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">But until that law comes into effect, no one is allowed to grow or consume marijuana unless they have a medical prescription, in Canada. Laws are subject to change, for more info visit <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/marijuana/law-loi.html">the Department of Justice's website.</a></p>
