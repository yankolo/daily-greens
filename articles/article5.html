                <p class="article-paragraph">The short-term effects vary from person to person. The size of the dose and the tolerance level of the user, has a major influence on the effects felt by the user. The classification of the effects are both visible and non-visible. It should be noted that THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the chemical in marijuana that affects the receptor nerve cells on the brain. </p>

				</figure>
				<p class="article-paragraph">Visible effects while under the influence of this drug are: Red-blood shot eyes, having a dry mouth, constantly coughing, having a fearful or anxious facial expression, a rapid heartbeat. As mentioned before, the intensity of the effects depend on the size of the dose. For example, if a user consumes 0.5 grams vs another user who consumes 1 gram, the user who consumed 0.5 grams, may not have the same visible effects.</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">Non-visible effects include: difficulty thinking and problem solving, problems with memory and learning, loss of coordination, distorted perception, an increase in appetite, and feeling light headed or drowsy. It should be noted that the psychological effects can affect your performance at school, work, and in any other stimulating setting. Marijuana should not be used if you are at school, since it may affect your ability to concentrate and be productive. It is a depressant used by many to relax, therefore it is advisable to use it only during recreational use, or medical use.</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">It is very important that you should not be under the influence of marijuana while driving a car or working with dangerous machinery. Since it may affect your coordination and your reasoning while under the influence.</p>
