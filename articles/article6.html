				<p class="article-paragraph">Marijuana—also called weed, herb, pot, grass, bud, ganja, Mary Jane, and a vast number of other slang terms—is a greenish-grey mixture of the dried, shredded leaves and flowers of Cannabis sativa, the hemp plant. Some people smoke marijuana in hand-rolled cigarettes called joints; many use pipes, water pipes (sometimes called bongs), or marijuana cigars called blunts (often made by slicing open cigars and replacing some or all of the tobacco with marijuana).</p>

				<p class="article-paragraph">Cannabis contains at least 60 types of cannabinoids, chemical compounds that act on receptors throughout our brain. THC, or Tetrahydrocannabinol, is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana’s effects, including the euphoric high. THC resembles another cannabinoid naturally produced in our brains, anandamide, which regulates our mood, sleep, memory, and appetite.</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">Essentially, cannabinoids’ effect on our brains is to keep our neurons firing, magnifying our thoughts and perception and keeping us fixed on them (until another thought takes us on a different tangent). That’s why when you’re high, it’s really not a good time to drive, study for a test, or play sports that require coordination, like tennis or baseball. Like alcohol, caffeine, and sugar, cannabinoids also affect the levels of dopamine in our brain, often resulting in a sense of relaxation and euphoria.</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">The oldest evidence of marijuana came from the Chinese Emperor Shen Nung in 2727 B.C. Marijuana was a multi-purpose plant in ancient China, used for writing, food and medicine. During war in ancient China, the warriors used it to make bowstrings for archers. This sacred plant of sativa was highly valued because of its usefulness during the war, that they started cultivating it as a war crop. </p>

				<p class="article-paragraph">In 2727 B.C., the ancient emperor of China known as Shen-Nung, wrote an encyclopedia on all the medicines he experimented with. Among the natural drugs he tested, marijuana mentioned as "ma", the plant cannabis. He documented that this drug contained both the yin(the passive, negative feelings) and the yang(the strong, positive feelings). He felt that it was important for the body to be in balance and when it was out of balance, the body was ill. Therefore, this drug helped keep the body in balance, specifically when a person had symptoms had constipation, absentmindness, gout and malaria.Cannabis was a mulitipurpose plant to the ancient Chinese. It has been cultivated and used for over 4000 years. It was used for war, writing, food, and medicine but there is very little mention of its psychoactive properties by the Chinese. It wasn't until India came upon cannabis that it became a widespread religious and medicinal intoxicant.  </p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">Nowadays, marijuana or named cannabis, weed, ganja or among many other names, is used mainly for medical purposes and recreational use. People consume it today to have a sense of pleasure rather than what the ancient Chinese used it for. The chemicals present is marijuana is a chemical called cannabinoids, this is what affects the central nervous system. </p>
