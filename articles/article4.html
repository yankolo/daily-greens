                <p class="article-paragraph">After interviewing previous marijuana users under 18 years old, they have mentioned that they do not experience any long term effects because of the drug. However, there are studies proving otherwise. Still today, the results are skewed. With the help of technological and scientific advancements, there are studies showing that marijuana does have long term effects.</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) brain scans show that marijuana users under 25 years old have smaller brains then a non-users. For instance, according to (Journal of Neuroscience 2014), there is evidence showing how the volume, shape and grey matter density of the brain changed. Particularly the nucleus accumbens (which plays a role in motivation, pleasure and reward processing) and the amygdala (the region responsible for memory, emotion and decision-making). Smokers who frequently consumed, had more changes in those two areas of the brain.</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">Researchers at Duke University concluded a study of more than 1000 people from the time they were born until they reached age 38. They found that those who used pot more than once weekly before the age 18 displayed more severely impaired intelligence, slower reaction times, shorter attention spans, and poorer listening skills than those who began using marijuana after age 18.</p>
